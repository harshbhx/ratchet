# HTTP API

The gateway (`ratchet/gateway.py`, FastAPI app `ratchet.gateway:app`) speaks the OpenAI chat-completions format, so any OpenAI SDK works. It also exposes a small Ratchet API for stats and provenance, mock-only demo controls, three web pages and the Scout demo endpoints.

```bash
RATCHET_MODE=mock uvicorn ratchet.gateway:app --port 8000      # offline demo
RATCHET_MODE=live NEBIUS_API_KEY=... uvicorn ratchet.gateway:app --port 8000
```

FastAPI also serves interactive docs at `/docs` and the schema at `/openapi.json`.

Errors on `/v1/*` use OpenAI's error envelope, so OpenAI SDKs raise typed exceptions with `code` and `param` ([Errors](#errors)); every other route answers errors as `{"detail": ...}`. Every `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` body is limited to `RATCHET_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (2 MiB by default; larger is **413**).

| Method | Path | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | both | Story page: the React app (`ratchet/web/dist/index.html`); falls back to `ratchet/web/landing.html` if the build is missing |
| GET | `/dashboard` | both | Dashboard (React app; fallback `ratchet/dashboard.html`) |
| GET | `/scout` | both | Scout demo page (React app; fallback `ratchet/web/scout.html`) |
| GET | `/assets/*` | both | Built JavaScript, CSS and fonts of the React app |
| GET | `/lite`, `/lite/scout`, `/lite/dashboard` | both | The hand-written pages (no build step, no JavaScript framework) |
| GET | `/healthz` | both | Liveness check; always public |
| GET | `/v1/models` | both | OpenAI-style model list (API key when keys are on) |
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | both | The cascade; `stream: true` supported (API key when keys are on) |
| GET | `/ratchet/stats` | both | Everything the dashboard shows |
| GET | `/ratchet/bom` | both | Bill of materials for the whole ledger (provenance) |
| GET | `/ratchet/versions/{id}/bom` | both | One adapter's bill of materials, written at training time, signed when a key is set |
| GET | `/ratchet/bom/public-key` | both | Ed25519 public key that verifies adapter BOMs |
| POST | `/ratchet/redact` | both | Show what the PII redactor would store for a text (stores nothing) |
| POST | `/ratchet/demo/day` | mock only | Simulate one day of traffic and one night of training |
| POST | `/ratchet/demo/break-next` | mock only | Make the next trained student deploy corrupted |
| POST | `/ratchet/demo/student-outage` | mock only | Take the student endpoint down for a while, to show the circuit breaker |
| POST | `/ratchet/demo/reset` | mock only | Start over |
| GET | `/scout/examples` | both | Example questions and whether free text is allowed |
| GET | `/scout/status` | both | Budget guard state |
| GET | `/scout/stream?q=` | both | Run Scout, stream events (Server-Sent Events) |
| POST | `/scout/run` | both | Run Scout, return all events at the end |

The three pages are static HTML files with no build step. If a page file is missing, the route returns a small placeholder page with links to the other two.

## Authentication

Off by default, so the mock demo and local runs need no key. Set `RATCHET_API_KEYS` ([CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#privacy-and-security)) to require a key on `/v1/*`:

```bash
RATCHET_API_KEYS="acme:$(openssl rand -hex 24),globex:$(openssl rand -hex 24)" uvicorn ratchet.gateway:app
```

- Send the key as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (what every OpenAI SDK sends as `api_key`) or as `X-API-Key: <key>`.
- A missing or wrong key returns **401** `invalid or missing API key` (error code `invalid_api_key`) with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. The key is checked before the body is read.
- The ledger records the key's **name** (`acme`) on every request it sends, never the key. `/ratchet/stats` reports requests, cost and savings per name under `clients`.
- `RATCHET_API_KEY_DAILY_REQUESTS=N` caps each key at N chat completions per UTC day. Responses carry `X-RateLimit-Limit-Requests`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Requests` and `X-RateLimit-Reset-Requests` (time to 00:00 UTC in OpenAI's duration format, rounded up to the second: `3h12m5s`). Past the cap the gateway returns **429** `insufficient_quota` (code `daily_quota_exceeded`) until 00:00 UTC, with `Retry-After` (seconds until then) and `X-Should-Retry: false`, so OpenAI SDKs send it once and do not retry. Only answered requests count: a refused request (400, 413, 429) uses no quota. Concurrent requests can overshoot the cap by the number in flight.
- Pages, `/healthz`, `/ratchet/*` and Scout stay public. The read-only `/ratchet/stats` and `/ratchet/bom` are what the dashboard reads; the mock-only demo controls are covered by the Caddy guard on the demo VM. Scout's agents call the cascade inside the process, so they never need a key; the Scout budget guard protects them.

The demo VM's Caddy config also has an opt-in edge guard for `/v1/*` and `/ratchet/demo/*` ([DEPLOY_NEBIUS_VM.md](DEPLOY_NEBIUS_VM.md#security-notes)). Use either or both. See [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md) T1 and T19.

## POST `/v1/chat/completions`

### Request

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `messages` | array of message objects | yes | 1 to `RATCHET_MAX_MESSAGES` (256) messages ([Messages](#messages)) |
| `model` | string | no | Ignored; Ratchet chooses the model. Use `"ratchet"` |
| `stream` | bool | no | `true` returns Server-Sent Events in the OpenAI chunk format ([Streaming](#streaming)) |
| `stream_options` | object | no | With `stream: true`, `{"include_usage": true}` ends the stream with a chunk that carries `usage` ([Streaming](#streaming)). Other keys are ignored, and so is the object without a stream. Never forwarded |
| `metadata` | object | no | Up to 16 string values. `metadata.ratchet_task` is the task name, used if the header is absent |
| `n` | integer | no | Must be 1 (one choice per request for now); 2 or more is a 400 `unsupported_value` |
| `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop`, `seed`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `logit_bias`, `logprobs`, `top_logprobs`, `response_format`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `reasoning_effort` | | no | Checked against OpenAI's rules ([Request validation](#request-validation)), then sent to each model as its role allows ([Generation parameters](#generation-parameters)). `max_completion_tokens` wins over `max_tokens`; a string `stop` counts as a one-item list |
| `functions`, `function_call`, `user`, `safety_identifier`, `store` | | no | Checked, not forwarded: the end user's identity and the storage choice never go upstream, and the legacy function fields are not mapped to `tools` yet |
| any other field | | no | Ignored on purpose: unknown fields are kept, not refused, so newer OpenAI SDKs and third-party clients that send fields Ratchet does not know (`service_tier`, `prompt_cache_key`, …) keep working. One is forwarded only when `RATCHET_TEACHER_PARAMS` or `RATCHET_STUDENT_PARAMS` names it (vLLM's `top_k`, for example) |

`null` for any optional field means it is not set.

| Header | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `X-Ratchet-Task` | Task name. Takes precedence over `metadata.ratchet_task`: when both are set, the header wins. Unknown names create a plain-text task on the fly (see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#tasks)); a header that is not a valid name means `default`. Missing means `metadata.ratchet_task`, else `default` |

#### Messages

| Role | Content | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `system`, `user` | string or array of content parts | |
| `developer` | string or array of content parts | OpenAI's newer name for `system`; Ratchet sends and stores it as `system` |
| `assistant` | string, array of parts, or `null` with `tool_calls` or `function_call` | `refusal` parts become text; may carry `refusal`, `tool_calls` and the legacy `function_call` |
| `tool` | string or array of text parts | Needs `tool_call_id` |
| `function` | string | Legacy |

A message keeps `role`, `content` and `name`, plus `refusal`, `tool_calls` and `function_call` in an assistant message and `tool_call_id` in a tool message; a tool call keeps `id`, `type` and `function` (`name`, `arguments`). Any other key (assistant `audio` or `annotations` sent back from a response, a vendor field) is dropped, as unknown top-level fields are ignored: it reaches neither the teacher nor the stored example. Before an example is stored, `name`, `refusal` and tool and function call arguments are redacted like content ([ADR 0009](adr/0009-pattern-based-pii-redaction.md)).

Content parts: `{"type": "text", "text": "..."}` in any message, and `{"type": "refusal", "refusal": "..."}` in assistant messages. A message made only of text parts is turned into one string, the parts joined by newlines, before anything else happens, so it is answered, deduplicated and stored exactly like the same text sent as a string. Messages already in the plain form pass through unchanged. Other part types (`image_url`, `input_audio`, `file`) get **400** `unsupported_content_type`, unless `RATCHET_TEACHER_MODALITIES` lists them ([CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#request-limits-and-openai-compatibility)): then the request goes to the teacher only, with the parts as sent, and nothing is stored as a training example. `RATCHET_MERGE_SYSTEM=1` merges consecutive leading system messages into one.

The task decides how answers are compared. `ticket-triage` compares only the JSON fields `category` and `priority`; `default` compares the whole normalised text. Pinned tasks (`research-plan`, `research-write`) skip the student and always go to the teacher; their answers are not stored as training examples. The full list is in [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#tasks).

#### Generation parameters

Each model call gets the client's parameters as its role allows ([ADR 0017](adr/0017-generation-parameters-by-role.md)). The allowlists and caps are environment variables ([CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#generation-parameters-and-token-caps)); the table shows the defaults.

| Field | Teacher, serving the answer (escalation, cold start, pinned, teacher-only) | Student (its samples, and a shadow's) | Teacher audit and arbitration |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens` | The client's + `RATCHET_TEACHER_REASONING_HEADROOM` (0), at most `RATCHET_TEACHER_MAX_TOKENS` (8,192); the cap when not sent | The client's, at most `RATCHET_STUDENT_MAX_TOKENS` (1,024); the cap when not sent | As when serving |
| `temperature` | The client's; 0 when not sent | 0.7, always | 0 |
| `n` | 1 | `RATCHET_SAMPLES` (3), always | 1 |
| `logprobs` | No (responses carry no logprobs yet) | On, always | Off |
| `top_logprobs` | No | The client's | No |
| `stop`, `response_format` | The client's | The client's | The client's |
| `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls` | No (tool calls are not returned yet) | No | As when serving |
| `seed`, `logit_bias` | The client's | The client's | No |
| `top_p`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty` | The client's | No | No |
| `reasoning_effort` | The client's | No | The client's |
| `model` | `RATCHET_TEACHER_MODEL`, always (invariant 1) | The version's adapter | `RATCHET_TEACHER_MODEL` |
| an unknown field | Only when `RATCHET_TEACHER_PARAMS` names it | Only when `RATCHET_STUDENT_PARAMS` names it | As when serving |

- The student's `n`, temperature and logprobs never change: its confidence is scored over those samples and its threshold was calibrated that way. A sample cut off by its token limit gets no vote, so a tight `max_tokens` can send a request to the teacher.
- `max_tokens` above a cap is capped, not refused.
- When the reasoning headroom gives the teacher more than the client asked for, an answer whose visible part (reasoning removed) is longer than the client's `max_tokens` (about 4 characters a token) comes back whole with `finish_reason: "length"`, and is not stored.
- `stop`, `response_format`, `tools` and `tool_choice` are stored with the example, redacted like the messages: the same messages under other conditions are another example (in the same golden or train split), and the nightly golden eval samples the student under them. Temperature, seed, penalties and `max_tokens` are not stored.
- A teacher answer written under a client's `logit_bias`, a non-zero `presence_penalty` or `frequency_penalty`, a `temperature` above 1, or a vendor field is returned as usual but never stored: a client may choose the answer it gets, not the label the student learns.
- `tools`, `tool_choice` and `parallel_tool_calls` reach no model by default, so a request with tools is answered in prose, as before v0.5. When an operator allows them for the teacher and it answers with a tool call, the response is **502** `tool_calls_unsupported` (with `X-Should-Retry: false`) until tool calls are passed through; a response never has `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` without them.

#### Request validation

Every rule runs before the quota check and before any model call; a refused request is not logged and costs nothing. Each 400 names the first problem: `param` is a JSON path to the field (`messages[2].content`, `response_format.json_schema.name`) and `code` says what is wrong (`invalid_type`, `invalid_value`, `missing_required_parameter`, `unsupported_value`).

| Field | Rule | `code` when broken |
|---|---|---|
| (body) | At most `RATCHET_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (2 MiB) | 413 `request_too_large` |
| (body) | Strict JSON (no `NaN` or `Infinity`), and a JSON object | `invalid_json`; `invalid_type` |
| any string | Valid Unicode: no unpaired UTF-16 surrogate (`"\ud83d"` alone, as code that cuts an emoji in half sends it), escaped or as bytes; `param` names where it is | `invalid_json` |
| `messages` | A non-empty array of at most `RATCHET_MAX_MESSAGES` (256) objects | `missing_required_parameter`, `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `messages[i].role` | `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool` or `function` | `invalid_value` |
| `messages[i].content` | A string, a non-empty array of content parts each with a string `type` (`text` parts need a string `text`, `refusal` parts a string `refusal`), or `null` only in an assistant message with `tool_calls` or `function_call` | `invalid_type`, `missing_required_parameter` |
| `messages[i].content[j].type` | `text`, `refusal` (assistant only) or a type in `RATCHET_TEACHER_MODALITIES` | `unsupported_content_type` |
| `messages[i].tool_call_id` | Required, a string, when the role is `tool` | `missing_required_parameter` |
| `messages[i].name`, `.refusal` | Strings (`refusal`: assistant only) | `invalid_type` |
| `messages[i].tool_calls[k]` | In an assistant message: `{"id": string, "type": "function", "function": {"name": string, "arguments": string}}`; other call types are `unsupported_value` | `invalid_type`, `missing_required_parameter`, `unsupported_value` |
| `messages[i].function_call` | In an assistant message: `{"name": string, "arguments": string}` | `invalid_type`, `missing_required_parameter` |
| all message text | At most `RATCHET_MAX_INPUT_CHARS` (120,000) characters: content strings and text and refusal parts, `name`, `refusal`, `tool_call_id`, and each tool call's id, function name and arguments, added up (`param`: `messages`). Non-text parts are bounded by `RATCHET_MAX_BODY_BYTES` only | `context_length_exceeded` |
| `temperature` / `top_p` | A number from 0 to 2 / from 0 to 1 | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `n` | 1 (an integer below 1 is `invalid_value`) | `unsupported_value` |
| `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens` | An integer of at least 1 | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `stop` | A string or an array of at most 4 strings | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty` | A number from -2 to 2 | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `seed` | An integer | `invalid_type` |
| `logprobs` / `top_logprobs` | A boolean / an integer from 0 to 20, only with `logprobs: true` | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `logit_bias` | An object of integers from -100 to 100 | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `metadata` | An object of at most 16 string values; keys up to 64 characters, values up to 512; `ratchet_task` 1 to 64 letters, digits, `_`, `.` or `-` | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `response_format` | `type` is `text`, `json_object` or `json_schema`. `json_schema` needs a `name` matching `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$`; its `schema`, if sent, must be an object of at most 64 KB and 16 levels | `missing_required_parameter`, `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `tools` | At most 128 entries of `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": ...}}` (name as above), at most 64 KB in all. Other tool types are `unsupported_value` | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value`, `unsupported_value` |
| `tool_choice` | `none`, `auto`, `required` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": ...}}` | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `functions`, `function_call` | The legacy forms: functions named as above; `none`, `auto` or `{"name": ...}` | `invalid_type`, `invalid_value` |
| `stream`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `store` | Booleans | `invalid_type` |
| `model`, `user`, `safety_identifier`, `reasoning_effort` / `stream_options` | Strings / an object | `invalid_type` |
| `stream_options.include_usage` | A boolean | `invalid_type` |

### Response (200)

A standard `chat.completion`, with every field OpenAI's has, plus a `ratchet` block:

    }
  }
}
```

| `ratchet` field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `served_by` | `student` or `teacher` |
| `student_version` | Version that answered; `null` when the teacher answered (including escalations) |
| `confidence` | Student confidence if a student was tried, else `null` |
| `escalated` | `true` if the student was tried and was below its threshold |
| `cost_usd` | Actual cost of this request, including audit, shadow and arbitration calls (a call that failed adds nothing) |
| `all_teacher_cost_usd` | Estimated cost if the teacher had answered alone |
| `latency_ms` | Student latency plus teacher latency when the teacher answered |
| `usage_breakdown` | Every model call of the request, as `{"in": prompt tokens, "out": completion tokens}` as that model reported them, or `null` for a call that was not made or failed: `student_samples` (one call for all n samples: the prompt once, every sample's output), `served` (the served answer: one of the student's samples, or the teacher's own call), `audit`, `shadow` (the candidate's samples) and `arbitration` ([Usage](#usage)) |

`model` is the model that produced the served answer: the adapter name (`student-vN`) or the teacher model ID.

`system_fingerprint` names the configuration that produced the answer: `fp_` and the first 12 hex digits of SHA-256 over `student|<adapter>|<version id>|<training-set hash>|<threshold>` for a student answer, or `teacher|<RATCHET_TEACHER_MODEL>` for a teacher answer. It is the same for every answer of one version, and changes when a promotion or a rollback puts another version in front (during a canary, both versions' fingerprints appear) or when a version's threshold changes. `service_tier` is always `default`. `choices[0].logprobs` is `null` (token logprobs are not returned yet), `message.refusal` is `null` and `message.annotations` is empty.

`message.content` is the served answer after `tasks.clean_answer`: model reasoning is never returned (a `<think>…</think>` block, anything before a lone `</think>`, an unterminated `<think>` that opens what is left and what follows), and for a structured task such as `ticket-triage` a code fence around the whole JSON answer is removed, so the content is bare JSON. A structured answer that is one JSON object is returned whole, so a tag quoted in its strings stays; a `<think>` after answer text is content too. A free-text answer keeps its code blocks. A teacher answer that was cut off by its token limit is still returned (and is not stored as training data), with `finish_reason: "length"`.

`finish_reason` is the served answer's: `stop`, `length` (cut off by `max_tokens` or a cap, or over the client's `max_tokens` with the reasoning headroom) or `content_filter`; any other value an upstream model reports is returned as `stop`. It is never `tool_calls`, because `message.tool_calls` is not returned yet ([Generation parameters](#generation-parameters)). A student answer is always one that ended by itself.

Response headers: `X-Ratchet-Served-By: student|teacher`, plus `X-RateLimit-Limit-Requests` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Requests` when a daily quota is set.

#### Usage

`usage` is the served answer's, as if the model that wrote it had answered the request alone ([ADR 0018](adr/0018-usage-reports-the-served-answer.md)):

| Field | Student answer | Teacher answer |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt_tokens` | The student's prompt tokens | The teacher's prompt tokens |
| `completion_tokens` | The chosen sample's tokens (one of n; the endpoint's `completion_tokens` split over the samples by their logprob counts) | The teacher's completion tokens, reasoning included, as OpenAI counts them for its reasoning models |
| `total_tokens` | `prompt_tokens + completion_tokens` | The same |
| `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` | The sample's share of the endpoint's reasoning tokens (0 for the tuned student) | What the teacher reported (Token Factory reports them; the mock teacher reports `RATCHET_TEACHER_REASONING_TOKENS`) |
| `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` | What the endpoint reported in `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, else 0 | The same |
| `audio_tokens`, `accepted_prediction_tokens`, `rejected_prediction_tokens` | 0 | 0 |

When the served model reported no prompt or completion count, Ratchet estimates it at about 4 characters a token (the messages as JSON; the answer as served), so `total_tokens` is never 0. Reasoning and cached tokens never exceed the counts they are part of.

`usage` is **not** what the request cost Ratchet. The other student samples, an audit, a shadow and an arbitration are listed in `ratchet.usage_breakdown`, and `ratchet.cost_usd` prices all of them. So the same answer reports the same `usage` whether or not it was audited or shadowed, and a client that bills its own users from `usage` charges them for the answer they got.

### Streaming

With `"stream": true` the response is `text/event-stream` in the format OpenAI SDKs expect: a first chunk with `delta.role`, content chunks of a few words each, a last chunk with the answer's `finish_reason` (`"stop"`, or `"length"` as above) and the same `ratchet` block as above, then `data: [DONE]`. Every chunk has the response's `id`, `created`, `model`, `system_fingerprint` and `service_tier`, and `logprobs: null` in its choice.

```text
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-…","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1792400000,"model":"student-v5","system_fingerprint":"fp_6c1e0f3a9b2d","service_tier":"default","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":"","refusal":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-…","object":"chat.completion.chunk",…,"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"{\"category\": \"billing\", "},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-…","object":"chat.completion.chunk",…,"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"ratchet":{"served_by":"student",…}}

data: [DONE]
```

With `"stream_options": {"include_usage": true}`, as OpenAI documents it: every chunk above has `"usage": null`, the finish chunk has no `ratchet` block, and one more chunk comes before `[DONE]`, with no choices, the same `usage` as the non-streamed response and the `ratchet` block:

```text
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-…","object":"chat.completion.chunk",…,"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":null}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-…","object":"chat.completion.chunk",…,"choices":[],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":104,"completion_tokens":31,"total_tokens":135,…},"ratchet":{"served_by":"student",…}}

data: [DONE]
```

The cascade has to see the student's whole answer to score its confidence before it decides who serves, so the answer is complete before the first chunk is sent: time to first token equals the full latency. Streaming exists so that clients built for streaming work unchanged. Errors (400, 401, 413, 429, 502, 504) are returned as normal JSON HTTP errors before the stream starts.

```python
for chunk in client.chat.completions.create(model="ratchet", messages=msgs, stream=True, stream_options={"include_usage": True}):
    if chunk.choices:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
    else:
        print("\n", chunk.usage.total_tokens, "tokens")
```

### Errors

Every error on `/v1/*` (and `/openai/*`) has OpenAI's envelope, which OpenAI SDKs turn into typed exceptions (`openai.BadRequestError`, `AuthenticationError`, `NotFoundError`, `RateLimitError`, `InternalServerError`, …) with `.code`, `.param` and `.type`:

```json
{
  "error": {"message": "Invalid value for 'temperature': expected a number from 0 to 2, but got 3 instead.",
            "type": "invalid_request_error", "param": "temperature", "code": "invalid_value"},
  "detail": "Invalid value for 'temperature': expected a number from 0 to 2, but got 3 instead."
}

`detail` repeats `error.message` for one release (v0.5), for clients written against earlier versions, then goes away: read `error`. Routes outside `/v1` (`/ratchet/*`, Scout, pages) keep FastAPI's `{"detail": ...}`.

| Status | `type` | `code` | When | Retried by OpenAI SDKs? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_request_error` | `invalid_json`, `invalid_type`, `invalid_value`, `missing_required_parameter`, `unsupported_value`, `context_length_exceeded`, `unsupported_content_type` | The request breaks a rule in [Request validation](#request-validation); `param` names the field | No |
| 400 | `invalid_request_error` | `null` | Mock mode only: the request is not a synthetic demo ticket or a Scout request from the mock research world (`mock mode only answers demo requests: '...'`) | No |
| 401 | `invalid_request_error` | `invalid_api_key` | API keys are on and the key is missing or wrong (`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`) | No |
| 404 | `not_found_error` | `unknown_url` | No such route: `Unknown request URL: POST /v1/foo.` | No |
| 405 | `invalid_request_error` | `null` | A route called with the wrong method (`Allow` names the right one) | No |
| 413 | `invalid_request_error` | `request_too_large` | The body is larger than `RATCHET_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | No |
| 400 | `invalid_request_error` | the teacher's (`context_length_exceeded`, ...), `request_too_large` for an upstream 413 without one, or `null` | Live mode: the teacher refused the request with 400, 413 or 422, so it cannot succeed as sent (too long for the model, a content part it cannot read). `message` and `param` are the teacher's; `X-Should-Retry: false` | No |
| 429 | `insufficient_quota` | `daily_quota_exceeded` | The key's daily quota is used up (`daily request quota of N used up for 'acme'; resets at 00:00 UTC`); `Retry-After` (seconds to 00:00 UTC), `X-RateLimit-Reset-Requests` and `X-Should-Retry: false` | No: the response tells them not to |
| 429 | `rate_limit_error` | `upstream_rate_limited` | Live mode: Token Factory rate-limited the teacher call, after the gateway's own retries (`teacher rate limited: upstream 429; retry after 7 s`). `Retry-After` is the teacher's wait, clamped to 1 to 60 s (1 when it sent none) | Yes, after `Retry-After` |
| 500 | `api_error` | `null` | A bug in the gateway (`The server had an error while processing your request.`). The message never includes request text; the ledger records a `gateway_error` event with the exception's class at the 1st, 10th, 100th, ... occurrence. In live mode this includes a `KeyError` from the cascade, which is a 400 only in mock mode | Yes |
| 502 | `api_error` | `teacher_unavailable` | Live mode: a teacher call whose answer was needed failed after its retries: an escalation, a cold start, a pinned task or a teacher-only request (`teacher unavailable: upstream 503`, `teacher unavailable: upstream 502 upstream_unreachable` when Token Factory could not be reached, `... bad_upstream_response` when its answer could not be read). Student failures do not cause errors: they fall back to the teacher. Neither do a failed audit or shadow arbitration: the student's answer is served ([ADR 0013](adr/0013-optional-teacher-calls-fail-open.md)). An upstream redirect or 4xx outside the other rows (402, for example) adds `X-Should-Retry: false`. When Token Factory sent a wait (`Retry-After` on a 503, for example), it is passed on as `Retry-After`, clamped to 1 to 60 s. See [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#teacher-api-down-token-factory-errors-or-timeouts) | Yes (after `Retry-After` when present), unless `X-Should-Retry: false` |
| 502 | `api_error` | `upstream_auth_error` | Live mode: Token Factory refused the gateway's own key (401 or 403): `NEBIUS_API_KEY` is wrong or lacks access. `X-Should-Retry: false` | No |
| 502 | `api_error` | `upstream_not_found` | Live mode: Token Factory answered 404: `RATCHET_TEACHER_MODEL` or `RATCHET_TEACHER_BASE` is wrong. The request's `model` never selects the teacher, so this is the gateway's configuration, not the client's mistake. `X-Should-Retry: false` | No |
| 502 | `api_error` | `tool_calls_unsupported` | Live mode, only when `RATCHET_TEACHER_PARAMS` allows `tools`: the teacher answered with a tool call, which the gateway cannot return yet (`The teacher answered with a tool call, which this gateway cannot return yet; send the request without tools.`). Nothing is stored. `X-Should-Retry: false` | No |
| 504 | `api_error` | `teacher_timeout` | Live mode: the teacher did not answer in time (`RATCHET_TEACHER_TIMEOUT_S`, retried once within `RATCHET_TEACHER_DEADLINE_S`), or Token Factory answered 504 (`teacher timeout: upstream 504 upstream_timeout`). Token Factory's `Retry-After`, if it sent one, is passed on (1 to 60 s) | Yes, after `Retry-After` when present |

OpenAI's Python and Node SDKs retry connection errors, 408, 409, 429 and 5xx responses twice by default, with backoff (or `Retry-After`, up to 60 s), unless the response carries `x-should-retry`. Set `max_retries=0` on the client to turn that off. Each retry of a request the student cannot answer runs the student's samples again, so the gateway marks the errors no retry can fix.

The gateway retries the teacher itself before any of these errors ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-upstream-failure-semantics.md), [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#upstream-timeouts-and-retries)): up to `RATCHET_TEACHER_RETRIES` (2) more attempts within `RATCHET_TEACHER_DEADLINE_S` (180 s), with full-jitter backoff or Token Factory's `Retry-After` (up to 8 s; a longer wait comes back to you at once, as the `Retry-After` of the 429, 502 or 504), on connection failures and 408, 409, 429, 500, 502, 503 and 504; a read timeout once at most, because its tokens may already be billed. The student is never retried on the request path: a failing student escalates to the teacher at once.

```python
import openai

try:
    client.chat.completions.create(model="ratchet", messages=msgs, temperature=3)
except openai.BadRequestError as e:
    print(e.status_code, e.code, e.param)  # 400 invalid_value temperature
```

### Examples

curl:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Ratchet-Task: ticket-triage' \
  -d '{"model":"ratchet","messages":[
        {"role":"system","content":"You triage customer support tickets. Reply with JSON only ..."},
        {"role":"user","content":"I was charged twice for my Pro plan this month. Order #48213."}]}'
```

OpenAI Python SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="unused")  # or your RATCHET_API_KEYS key
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="ratchet",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "I was charged twice this month."}],
    extra_headers={"X-Ratchet-Task": "ticket-triage"},
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
print(resp.model_extra["ratchet"])  # served_by, confidence, cost_usd, ...
```

OpenAI Node SDK:

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI({ baseURL: "http://localhost:8000/v1", apiKey: "unused" });
const r = await client.chat.completions.create(
  { model: "ratchet", messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Where is my order #48213?" }] },
  { headers: { "X-Ratchet-Task": "ticket-triage" } },
);
```

In mock mode, only the synthetic tickets generated by `sim/tickets.py` and Scout's requests for the example questions (`sim/research.py`) can be answered. Use the demo endpoints, take a ticket from `sim.tickets.TicketStream` in Python, or run the Scout CLI (`python -m ratchet.scout "What is LoRA fine-tuning?" --base-url http://localhost:8000/v1`).

- `days`: one entry per `requests.day` (see `Ledger.stats_by_day`). `audit_agreement` is `null` on days without audits.
- `tasks`: one entry per task name over all days, busiest first (`Ledger.stats_by_task`). `student_share` and `escalation_rate` are shares of that task's requests; `savings_pct = 1 − cost_usd / baseline_usd`. Pinned tasks always show `student_share` 0 and `savings_pct` 0. `pinned` is true for tasks that always go to the teacher and are never trained on (`research-plan`, `research-write`); the dashboard's **By task** table shows them as "pinned to teacher". `routes` counts the task's requests by how they were served (the ledger's `requests.route`), most frequent first, and adds up to `requests`:

  | Route | Served by | Why |
  |---|---|---|
  | `student` | student | Its confidence reached the version's threshold |
  | `confidence` | teacher | The student was unsure (below the threshold) |
  | `cold_start` | teacher | No version serves yet (no live version, and the canary was not picked) |
  | `pinned` | teacher | A pinned task, or a request with a part only the teacher reads (`RATCHET_TEACHER_MODALITIES`) |
  | `student_error` | teacher | The student call failed (timeout, connection error, an error status, a lost adapter) |
  | `student_breaker` | teacher | The student's circuit breaker was open, so the student was not called ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#student-circuit-breaker)) |
  | `unrecorded` | either | Requests logged before v0.5, when the ledger had no route column |

  Later versions add routes; a client should show an unknown route as it is.
- `versions`: every version, oldest first. `bom` is `signed`, `unsigned`, or `null` for versions trained before v0.4.
- `clients`: one entry per API key name that sent requests, busiest first (`Ledger.stats_by_client`). Empty when keys are off.
- `privacy`: whether redaction is on, how many stored examples had at least one identifier replaced, and how many placeholders were inserted in total (`Ledger.privacy_stats`).
- `security`: whether API keys are required, the daily quota per key (`null` = none), and whether adapter BOMs are signed (with the key id: the first 16 hex characters of the public key's SHA-256).
- `events`: the last 40 events, oldest first. `id` is the ledger row id (stable, use it as a key); `ts` is Unix time.

Compatibility: the keys the dashboard reads are listed with their JSON types in `tests/fixtures/stats_keys.json`, and `test_stats_contract` checks them on every run. New versions add keys; they do not remove or retype existing ones, so a client written against this page keeps working.

## GET `/ratchet/bom`

```json
{
  "generated_at": 1792400000.0,
  "examples_sha256": "07ac2ca35bac78959378cbabd98352540…",
  "sources": [
    {"teacher_model": "nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b", "license": "OpenMDW-1.1",
     "license_url": "https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B-BF16",
     "split": "train", "n": 2085}
  ]
}
```

`examples_sha256` is a SHA-256 over all example hashes in sorted order. Two ledgers with the same examples give the same fingerprint.

## GET `/ratchet/versions/{id}/bom`

The bill of materials of one adapter, written by Night School right after training and evaluation, from the exact rows it was trained and evaluated on. **404** for an unknown id or a version trained before v0.4.

```json
{
  "manifest": {
    "schema": "ratchet.bom/v1",
    "generator": "ratchet 0.4.0",
    "created_at": "2026-10-20T00:15:12Z",
    "adapter": {"version": 1, "name": "student-v1", "base_model": "nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-BF16", "day": 1},
    "training": {"examples": 1029, "dataset_sha256": "478eef…", "tasks": {"ticket-triage": 420, "source-triage": 362, "page-read": 247},
                 "targets": "teacher answers only", "examples_with_pii_redacted": 0},
    "golden": {"examples": 110, "sha256": "cbce0e…", "held_out": true},
    "sources": [{"teacher": "nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b", "license": "OpenMDW-1.1",
                 "license_url": "https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B-BF16",
                 "distill_ok": true, "examples": 1029}],
    "eval": {"golden_n": 110, "golden_agreement": 0.89, "threshold": 0.65, "coverage": 0.96, "precision": 0.94, "test_n": 55}
  },
  "sha256": "9b1f…",
  "signature": {"alg": "Ed25519", "key_id": "6cf6bc1a39c4491d", "public_key": "IiNlIP8Y…", "value": "k2Hc…"}
}
```

- `sha256` and the signature cover the **canonical** manifest: JSON with sorted keys, no whitespace, UTF-8 (`ratchet.bom.canonical`).
- `signature` is `null` when `RATCHET_BOM_SIGNING_KEY` is not set; the `sha256` still detects edits.
- `training.dataset_sha256` equals the version's `dataset_hash`; `golden.sha256` fingerprints the golden rows the evaluation used. The `eval` block is the evaluation at training time; later re-checks update `/ratchet/stats` but not the signed BOM.

Verify a downloaded BOM against the public key you published:

```bash
curl -s https://<gateway>/ratchet/versions/3/bom > bom.json
python -m ratchet.bom verify bom.json --public-key "<base64 public key>"
# OK: signature valid (Ed25519, key 6cf6bc1a39c4491d, trusted key)
```

Without `--public-key` the check uses the key embedded in the document, which only proves the document is consistent with itself.

## GET `/ratchet/bom/public-key`

```json
{"alg": "Ed25519", "public_key": "IiNlIP8YSYKDKqEHNzxBnn+m37imeLeykRmrZEEl5I4=", "key_id": "6cf6bc1a39c4491d"}
```

`public_key` and `key_id` are `null` when signing is off. Publish the key somewhere you control as well (README, website): a key served by the same gateway proves nothing if the gateway itself is compromised.

## POST `/ratchet/redact`

Runs the PII redactor ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#pii-redaction)) on a text and returns what would be stored. Nothing is logged or stored. Backs the dashboard's **Try the redactor** box.

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/ratchet/redact -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "I am bob@example.com, card 4111 1111 1111 1111"}'
```

```json
{"text": "I am [EMAIL], card [CARD]", "found": {"EMAIL": 1, "CARD": 1}, "enabled": true}
```

`enabled` says whether this gateway redacts examples (`RATCHET_REDACT_PII`); the preview runs either way. **400** when `text` is missing or longer than 5,000 characters.

---

## Demo controls (mock mode only)

All four return **403** `demo controls are only available in mock mode` when `RATCHET_MODE=live`.

The mock demo is shared by every visitor, so the controls protect themselves:

- **One demo action at a time.** `day` and `reset` take a lock without waiting. If another `day` or `reset` is still running, the call returns **409** `another demo action is running; try again in a moment`. (`break-next` and `student-outage` do not take the lock.)
- **Reset cooldown.** `reset` returns **429** `the demo was reset less than 30 seconds ago` within 30 seconds (`RESET_COOLDOWN_S`) of the last successful reset.

The dashboard shows these messages under its buttons.

### POST `/ratchet/demo/day?requests=1500&workload=tickets`

Advances `Ledger.day` by one and sends `requests` simulated requests through the cascade, calling `gate.tick()` every `requests/10`. Then it runs one night (`run_night`). `requests` is clamped to 100–5000.

| Query param | Default | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `requests` | `1500` | Requests for the day (clamped to 100–5000) |
| `workload` | `tickets` | `tickets` (support tickets), `research` (Scout's triage and reader calls), `mixed` (half each). Anything else returns **400** `workload must be one of [...]` |

With `workload=tickets` the night trains on `ticket-triage` only, as in v0.1. With `research` or `mixed` it trains on every stored task. Each workload has its own seeded stream, so the three streams do not affect each other. The dashboard's **Traffic** selector sets `workload` (default there: `mixed`).

```json
{"day": 4, "workload": "tickets",
 "night": {"trained": false, "version": null, "admitted": false,
           "reason": "release in flight", "eval": null}}
```

`night.reason` is one of `admitted`, `rejected`, `release in flight`, `not enough new data`, `no golden set`.

### POST `/ratchet/demo/break-next`

Marks the next version name (`student-v{count+1}`) to be served corrupted once it reaches canary or live. Its billing, refund and security answers become confidently wrong. This is used to demonstrate automatic rollback. It writes a `fault` event.

```json
{"corrupt": "student-v4"}
```

### POST `/ratchet/demo/student-outage?seconds=60`

Fault injection for the student circuit breaker: for `seconds` (clamped to 5–300, default 60) every call to the production student endpoint, which serves the live and canary versions, fails as an unreachable endpoint does (`httpx.ConnectError`). Shadow candidates run on the mock staging endpoint and are not affected. It writes a `fault` event and returns when the outage ends (Unix time):

```json
{"seconds": 60, "until": 1792400060.0}
```

Send traffic (Scout, or **Run 1 day + night**) and the release log shows the breaker at work: a `student_error` event for the first failure (`v2: ConnectError`; later ones are logged on the 10th, 100th and 1000th), then, after 5 failures in a row, `circuit` `student: closed->open after 5 failures (ConnectError)`; requests go straight to the teacher (route `student_breaker`); after 30 s one probe (`open->half_open`), which fails while the outage lasts and doubles the wait (`half_open->open for 60 s ...`); once the endpoint is back, a probe succeeds and `half_open->closed`. Calling it again starts a new outage of the given length from now.

### POST `/ratchet/demo/reset`

Rebuilds the runtime: new in-memory ledger, new mock fleet, all three traffic streams reset, new Scout budget guard. If `RATCHET_MOCK_WARMUP_DAYS` is set, the warm-up runs again before the call returns.

```json
{"status": "reset"}
```

---

## Scout endpoints

Scout is the multi-agent research demo. The event contract (every field of `start`, `step`, `done` and `error` events) is in [SCOUT.md](SCOUT.md#event-objects-sse-data-payloads-in-order). This section covers the HTTP side.

Before a run starts, both run endpoints check, in this order:

| Check | `/scout/run` | `/scout/stream` |
|---|---|---|
| Question empty after trimming | 400 `Ask a question.` | `error` event |
| Question longer than 300 characters | 400 | `error` event |
| Mock mode and the question is not one of the example questions (exact match) | 400 | `error` event |
| Live mode without `TAVILY_API_KEY` | 503 | `error` event |
| Budget guard refuses: daily budget used, daily run cap reached, or per-IP hourly limit | 429 (message says which) | `error` event |

A run that passes these checks counts against the per-IP hourly limit and the daily run cap, even if it fails later. Its spend is added to the daily total step by step, so a run that fails halfway still counts what it spent.

The client IP is the TCP peer address, or the first `X-Forwarded-For` entry when `RATCHET_TRUST_PROXY=1` ([CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#scout-the-multi-agent-demo)).

### GET `/scout/examples`

```json
{"mode": "mock", "examples": ["What is LoRA fine-tuning?", "What is knowledge distillation?", "..."], "free_text": false}
```

`examples` is `ratchet.scout.prompts.EXAMPLE_QUESTIONS` (8 questions). `free_text` is `true` only in live mode.

### GET `/scout/status`

```json
{"mode": "live", "budget_usd": 3.0, "spent_today_usd": 0.0412, "runs_today": 3,
 "runs_per_hour_per_ip": 6, "max_runs_per_day": 30, "tavily": true}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `budget_usd` | `RATCHET_SCOUT_DAILY_BUDGET_USD`; `null` in mock mode (no budget) |
| `spent_today_usd` | Ratchet spend on Scout runs this UTC day (`cost_usd` of every step, including audits) |
| `runs_today` | Runs admitted this UTC day |
| `runs_per_hour_per_ip` | Per-IP limit. Mock mode uses 10 × `RATCHET_SCOUT_RUNS_PER_HOUR` |
| `max_runs_per_day` | `RATCHET_SCOUT_MAX_RUNS_PER_DAY`; `null` in mock mode (no cap) |
| `tavily` | `true` when live search (Tavily) is configured |

The counters live in memory and reset at 00:00 UTC and when the process restarts.

### GET `/scout/stream?q=<question>`

Server-Sent Events (`text/event-stream`). Each event is one `data:` line holding a JSON object: `start`, then `step` events as agents finish, then `done`. Lines starting with `:` are keep-alive comments, sent every 15 seconds while waiting.

This endpoint **always answers HTTP 200**, because the browser's `EventSource` cannot read status codes. Any failure, before or during the run, arrives as a single `error` event, which ends the stream.

In mock mode the run waits `RATCHET_MOCK_PACE` × each call's simulated latency, so the page shows agents working.

```bash
curl -sN "http://localhost:8000/scout/stream?q=What%20is%20LoRA%20fine-tuning%3F"
```

### POST `/scout/run`

Request body: `{"question": "What is LoRA fine-tuning?"}`. Runs without pacing and returns once the run ends:

```json
{"events": [{"type": "start", "...": "..."}, {"type": "step", "...": "..."}, {"type": "done", "...": "..."}]}
```

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 200 | Run finished; the last event is `done` |
| 400 / 429 / 503 | Pre-run checks above |
| 502 | The run failed partway: a model or search call failed (`a model or search call failed: upstream 503`, or `upstream 502 upstream_unreachable`, `upstream 504 upstream_timeout`: the status and code, never the URL), or anything else raised (`run failed: <type>: <message>`). `detail` is the `error` event's message |

## Python API (embedding Ratchet without HTTP)

```python
from ratchet.config import Settings
from ratchet.ledger import Ledger
from ratchet.providers import OpenAICompatProvider
from ratchet.release import ReleaseGate
from ratchet.router import Ratchet

s = Settings(mode="live")
ledger = Ledger(s.db_path)
# The gateway's timeouts and retries: the teacher retried within its deadline, the student never (the teacher is its retry).
teacher = OpenAICompatProvider(s.teacher_base, s.teacher_api_key, timeout=s.teacher_timeout(), retry=s.teacher_retry())
student = OpenAICompatProvider(s.student_base, s.student_api_key, timeout=s.student_timeout())
r = Ratchet(s, ledger, teacher, lambda v: (student, v.adapter_uri))
gate = ReleaseGate(ledger)

result = r.handle([{"role": "user", "content": "..."}], "ticket-triage")
gate.tick()
print(result.served_by, result.text, result.cost_usd)

# With the client's generation parameters (what the gateway passes) and what else the caller knows:
from ratchet.providers import GenParams
from ratchet.router import RequestMeta

result = r.handle(msgs, "ticket-triage", client="acme", params=GenParams(max_tokens=200, stop=("\n\n",)), meta=RequestMeta())
print(result.finish_reason)  # "stop", or "length" when the answer was cut off
print(result.prompt_tokens, result.completion_tokens, result.total_tokens, result.fingerprint)
```

`handle(messages, task=None, client=None, params=None, meta=None)`: `task` is a task name or a `tasks.Task`; `params` (`providers.GenParams`, `GenParams.from_request(chat_request)` in the gateway) are sent to each call as `Settings.gen_policy()` allows ([Generation parameters](#generation-parameters)); `meta` (`router.RequestMeta`) carries what else the caller knows, and `RequestMeta(storable=False)` keeps the request's teacher answers out of the training set. A provider's `complete(messages, model, n, temperature, logprobs, response_format, params=None, **_)` receives the role's `GenParams`; the explicit arguments win over the same fields in it.

`result.route` says how the request was served (the routes table under [`/ratchet/stats`](#get-ratchetstats)); `result.text` is the answer after `tasks.clean_answer`. `result.prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `reasoning_tokens`, `cached_tokens` and `total_tokens` are the response's [usage](#usage), `result.usage_breakdown` its `ratchet.usage_breakdown` (keys in `router.USAGE_PARTS`), and `result.fingerprint` its `system_fingerprint` (`router.fingerprint(...)`). Each `Completion` a provider returns carries `finish_reason` (`stop` when the server leaves it out or sends an empty string), `reasoning_tokens` and `cached_tokens` (from `usage.prompt_tokens_details`, 0 when absent); only a teacher answer with `finish_reason` `stop` or `tool_calls` that is non-empty and valid for its task is stored (invariant 16), and `requests.stored` says whether a request stored one. `r.health()` returns the failure counters (`student_errors`, `audit_errors`, `shadow_errors`) and `breakers`: each student breaker's state by name (`student`, `shadow`), as `{"state": "closed" | "open" | "half_open", "failures": n, "open_until": t, "open_s": s}`, where `open_until` is on the breaker's clock (`time.monotonic()` unless `Ratchet(clock=...)` was given). `Ratchet(..., on_adapter_missing=callback)` is called with the version when vLLM answers 404 for its adapter; the gateway passes `live.AdapterReloader.request`.

When the teacher's answer was needed and the teacher failed after its retries, `handle` raises `ratchet.providers.UpstreamError` (an `httpx.HTTPError`): `status` (504 for a timeout, 502 when Token Factory could not be reached), and the teacher's `type`, `code`, `param`, `message` and `retry_after` when it sent them. It never carries the URL or headers.
