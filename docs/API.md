# HTTP API

The gateway (`ratchet/gateway.py`, FastAPI app `ratchet.gateway:app`) speaks the OpenAI chat-completions format, so any OpenAI SDK works. It also exposes a small Ratchet API for stats and provenance, mock-only demo controls, three web pages and the Scout demo endpoints.

```bash
RATCHET_MODE=mock uvicorn ratchet.gateway:app --port 8000      # offline demo
RATCHET_MODE=live NEBIUS_API_KEY=... uvicorn ratchet.gateway:app --port 8000
```

FastAPI also serves interactive docs at `/docs` and the schema at `/openapi.json`.

| Method | Path | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | both | Story page: the React app (`ratchet/web/dist/index.html`); falls back to `ratchet/web/landing.html` if the build is missing |
| GET | `/dashboard` | both | Dashboard (React app; fallback `ratchet/dashboard.html`) |
| GET | `/scout` | both | Scout demo page (React app; fallback `ratchet/web/scout.html`) |
| GET | `/assets/*` | both | Built JavaScript, CSS and fonts of the React app |
| GET | `/lite`, `/lite/scout`, `/lite/dashboard` | both | The hand-written pages (no build step, no JavaScript framework) |
| GET | `/v1/models` | both | OpenAI-style model list |
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | both | The cascade |
| GET | `/ratchet/stats` | both | Everything the dashboard shows |
| GET | `/ratchet/bom` | both | Model bill of materials (provenance) |
| POST | `/ratchet/demo/day` | mock only | Simulate one day of traffic and one night of training |
| POST | `/ratchet/demo/break-next` | mock only | Make the next trained student deploy corrupted |
| POST | `/ratchet/demo/reset` | mock only | Start over |
| GET | `/scout/examples` | both | Example questions and whether free text is allowed |
| GET | `/scout/status` | both | Budget guard state |
| GET | `/scout/stream?q=` | both | Run Scout, stream events (Server-Sent Events) |
| POST | `/scout/run` | both | Run Scout, return all events at the end |

The three pages are static HTML files with no build step. If a page file is missing, the route returns a small placeholder page with links to the other two.

> **No authentication in v0.1.** The gateway does not check any API key. Put it behind a private network or an authenticating proxy before exposing it (see [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md)). The demo VM's Caddy config has an opt-in guard for `/v1/*` and `/ratchet/demo/*` ([DEPLOY_NEBIUS_VM.md](DEPLOY_NEBIUS_VM.md#security-notes)).

## POST `/v1/chat/completions`

### Request

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `messages` | array of `{role, content}` | yes | Must be a non-empty list, or the response is 400 |
| `model` | string | no | Ignored; Ratchet chooses the model. Use `"ratchet"` |
| `stream` | bool | no | `true` returns 400 (streaming not supported yet) |
| `metadata.ratchet_task` | string | no | Task name, used if the header is absent |
| any other field | | no | Ignored (`temperature`, `max_tokens`, `tools`, … are not forwarded in v0.1) |

| Header | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `X-Ratchet-Task` | Task name. Takes precedence over `metadata.ratchet_task`. Unknown names create a plain-text task on the fly (see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#tasks)). Missing means `default` |

The task decides how answers are compared. `ticket-triage` compares only the JSON fields `category` and `priority`; `default` compares the whole normalised text. Pinned tasks (`research-plan`, `research-write`) skip the student and always go to the teacher; their answers are not stored as training examples. The full list is in [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#tasks).

### Response (200)

Standard `chat.completion` plus a `ratchet` block:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-3f1c0a9b8e7d6c5b4a3f2e1d",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1792400000,
  "model": "student-v5",
  "choices": [
    {"index": 0, "finish_reason": "stop",
     "message": {"role": "assistant",
                 "content": "{\"category\": \"billing\", \"priority\": \"medium\", \"reply\": \"Sorry about the billing trouble, I'm checking your charges now.\"}"}}
  ],
  "ratchet": {
    "served_by": "student",
    "student_version": 5,
    "confidence": 0.951,
    "escalated": false,
    "cost_usd": 0.0000312,
    "all_teacher_cost_usd": 0.00131,
    "latency_ms": 311.4
  }
}
```

| `ratchet` field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `served_by` | `student` or `teacher` |
| `student_version` | Version that answered; `null` when the teacher answered (including escalations) |
| `confidence` | Student confidence if a student was tried, else `null` |
| `escalated` | `true` if the student was tried and was below its threshold |
| `cost_usd` | Actual cost of this request, including audit, shadow and arbitration calls |
| `all_teacher_cost_usd` | Estimated cost if the teacher had answered alone |
| `latency_ms` | Student latency plus teacher latency when the teacher answered |

`model` is the model that produced the served answer: the adapter name (`student-vN`) or the teacher model ID. `usage` is not returned in v0.1.

Response header: `X-Ratchet-Served-By: student|teacher`.

### Errors

| Status | When | Body `detail` |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `stream: true` | `streaming is not supported yet` |
| 400 | `messages` missing, not a list, or empty | `messages is required` |
| 400 | Mock mode, the last user message is not a synthetic demo ticket or a Scout request from the mock research world | `mock mode only answers demo tickets: '...'` |
| 422 | Body is not JSON | FastAPI validation error |
| 502 | Live mode: the teacher call failed (`httpx` error) | `{"detail": "teacher unavailable: ConnectError"}`. Student failures do not cause errors: they fall back to the teacher. See [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#playbooks) |

### Examples

curl:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Ratchet-Task: ticket-triage' \
  -d '{"model":"ratchet","messages":[
        {"role":"system","content":"You triage customer support tickets. Reply with JSON only ..."},
        {"role":"user","content":"I was charged twice for my Pro plan this month. Order #48213."}]}'
```

OpenAI Python SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="unused")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="ratchet",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "I was charged twice this month."}],
    extra_headers={"X-Ratchet-Task": "ticket-triage"},
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
print(resp.model_extra["ratchet"])  # served_by, confidence, cost_usd, ...
```

OpenAI Node SDK:

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI({ baseURL: "http://localhost:8000/v1", apiKey: "unused" });
const r = await client.chat.completions.create(
  { model: "ratchet", messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Where is my order #48213?" }] },
  { headers: { "X-Ratchet-Task": "ticket-triage" } },
);
```

In mock mode, only the synthetic tickets generated by `sim/tickets.py` and Scout's requests for the example questions (`sim/research.py`) can be answered. Use the demo endpoints, take a ticket from `sim.tickets.TicketStream` in Python, or run the Scout CLI (`python -m ratchet.scout "What is LoRA fine-tuning?" --base-url http://localhost:8000/v1`).

- `days`: one entry per `requests.day` (see `Ledger.stats_by_day`). `audit_agreement` is `null` on days without audits.
- `tasks`: one entry per task name over all days, busiest first (`Ledger.stats_by_task`). `student_share` and `escalation_rate` are shares of that task's requests; `savings_pct = 1 − cost_usd / baseline_usd`. Pinned tasks always show `student_share` 0 and `savings_pct` 0. `pinned` is true for tasks that always go to the teacher and are never trained on (`research-plan`, `research-write`); the dashboard's **By task** table shows them as "pinned to teacher".
- `versions`: every version, oldest first.
- `events`: the last 40 events, oldest first. `id` is the ledger row id (stable, use it as a key); `ts` is Unix time.

## GET `/ratchet/bom`

```json
{
  "generated_at": 1792400000.0,
  "examples_sha256": "07ac2ca35bac78959378cbabd98352540…",

     "split": "train", "n": 2085}
  ]
}
```

`examples_sha256` is a SHA-256 over all example hashes in sorted order. Two ledgers with the same examples give the same fingerprint.

## Demo controls (mock mode only)

All three return **403** `demo controls are only available in mock mode` when `RATCHET_MODE=live`.

The mock demo is shared by every visitor, so the controls protect themselves:

- **One demo action at a time.** `day` and `reset` take a lock without waiting. If another `day` or `reset` is still running, the call returns **409** `another demo action is running; try again in a moment`. (`break-next` does not take the lock.)
- **Reset cooldown.** `reset` returns **429** `the demo was reset less than 30 seconds ago` within 30 seconds (`RESET_COOLDOWN_S`) of the last successful reset.

The dashboard shows these messages under its buttons.

### POST `/ratchet/demo/day?requests=1500&workload=tickets`

Advances `Ledger.day` by one and sends `requests` simulated requests through the cascade, calling `gate.tick()` every `requests/10`. Then it runs one night (`run_night`). `requests` is clamped to 100–5000.

| Query param | Default | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `requests` | `1500` | Requests for the day (clamped to 100–5000) |
| `workload` | `tickets` | `tickets` (support tickets), `research` (Scout's triage and reader calls), `mixed` (half each). Anything else returns **400** `workload must be one of [...]` |

With `workload=tickets` the night trains on `ticket-triage` only, as in v0.1. With `research` or `mixed` it trains on every stored task. Each workload has its own seeded stream, so the three streams do not affect each other. The dashboard's **Traffic** selector sets `workload` (default there: `mixed`).

```json
{"day": 4, "workload": "tickets",
 "night": {"trained": false, "version": null, "admitted": false,
           "reason": "release in flight", "eval": null}}
```

`night.reason` is one of `admitted`, `rejected`, `release in flight`, `not enough new data`, `no golden set`.

### POST `/ratchet/demo/break-next`

Marks the next version name (`student-v{count+1}`) to be served corrupted once it reaches canary or live. Its billing, refund and security answers become confidently wrong. This is used to demonstrate automatic rollback. It writes a `fault` event.

```json
{"corrupt": "student-v4"}
```

### POST `/ratchet/demo/reset`

Rebuilds the runtime: new in-memory ledger, new mock fleet, all three traffic streams reset, new Scout budget guard. If `RATCHET_MOCK_WARMUP_DAYS` is set, the warm-up runs again before the call returns.

```json
{"status": "reset"}
```

## Scout endpoints

Scout is the multi-agent research demo. The event contract (every field of `start`, `step`, `done` and `error` events) is in [SCOUT.md](SCOUT.md#event-objects-sse-data-payloads-in-order). This section covers the HTTP side.

Before a run starts, both run endpoints check, in this order:

| Check | `/scout/run` | `/scout/stream` |
|---|---|---|
| Question empty after trimming | 400 `Ask a question.` | `error` event |
| Question longer than 300 characters | 400 | `error` event |
| Mock mode and the question is not one of the example questions (exact match) | 400 | `error` event |
| Live mode without `TAVILY_API_KEY` | 503 | `error` event |
| Budget guard refuses: daily budget used, daily run cap reached, or per-IP hourly limit | 429 (message says which) | `error` event |

A run that passes these checks counts against the per-IP hourly limit and the daily run cap, even if it fails later. Its spend is added to the daily total step by step, so a run that fails halfway still counts what it spent.

The client IP is the TCP peer address, or the first `X-Forwarded-For` entry when `RATCHET_TRUST_PROXY=1` ([CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#scout-the-multi-agent-demo)).

### GET `/scout/examples`

```json
{"mode": "mock", "examples": ["What is LoRA fine-tuning?", "What is knowledge distillation?", "..."], "free_text": false}
```

`examples` is `ratchet.scout.prompts.EXAMPLE_QUESTIONS` (8 questions). `free_text` is `true` only in live mode.

### GET `/scout/status`

```json
{"mode": "live", "budget_usd": 3.0, "spent_today_usd": 0.0412, "runs_today": 3,
 "runs_per_hour_per_ip": 6, "max_runs_per_day": 30, "tavily": true}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `budget_usd` | `RATCHET_SCOUT_DAILY_BUDGET_USD`; `null` in mock mode (no budget) |
| `spent_today_usd` | Ratchet spend on Scout runs this UTC day (`cost_usd` of every step, including audits) |
| `runs_today` | Runs admitted this UTC day |
| `runs_per_hour_per_ip` | Per-IP limit. Mock mode uses 10 × `RATCHET_SCOUT_RUNS_PER_HOUR` |
| `max_runs_per_day` | `RATCHET_SCOUT_MAX_RUNS_PER_DAY`; `null` in mock mode (no cap) |
| `tavily` | `true` when live search (Tavily) is configured |

The counters live in memory and reset at 00:00 UTC and when the process restarts.

### GET `/scout/stream?q=<question>`

Server-Sent Events (`text/event-stream`). Each event is one `data:` line holding a JSON object: `start`, then `step` events as agents finish, then `done`. Lines starting with `:` are keep-alive comments, sent every 15 seconds while waiting.

This endpoint **always answers HTTP 200**, because the browser's `EventSource` cannot read status codes. Any failure, before or during the run, arrives as a single `error` event, which ends the stream.

In mock mode the run waits `RATCHET_MOCK_PACE` × each call's simulated latency, so the page shows agents working.

```bash
curl -sN "http://localhost:8000/scout/stream?q=What%20is%20LoRA%20fine-tuning%3F"
```

### POST `/scout/run`

Request body: `{"question": "What is LoRA fine-tuning?"}`. Runs without pacing and returns once the run ends:

```json
{"events": [{"type": "start", "...": "..."}, {"type": "step", "...": "..."}, {"type": "done", "...": "..."}]}
```

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 200 | Run finished; the last event is `done` |
| 400 / 429 / 503 | Pre-run checks above |
| 502 | The run failed partway: a model or search call raised an `httpx` error (`a model or search call failed: ConnectError`), or anything else raised (`run failed: <type>: <message>`). `detail` is the `error` event's message |
| 422 | Body is not JSON |
